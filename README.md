GraphNetwork is a Java Swing applet that I developed while working on the industrial placement of my BSc. It is a tool for creating graphs, applying common and research algorithms on them, and observing their behaviour.

I'd like to see someone getting GraphNetwork and extending it. Please keep me informed if you find it useful.
