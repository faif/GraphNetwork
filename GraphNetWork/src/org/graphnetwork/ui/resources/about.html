      <p><b>Graph:</b> Create graphs and display graph information.</p> 

      <p><b>Graph => Create random graph:</b> Use this opion to create a  graph with a random number of vertices and edges.</p>

      <p><b>Graph => Display weights:</b> This option is enabled after the creation of a graph. It opens a small window which displays the weights of the edges of the graph.</p>

      <p><b>Algorithms:</b> Execute various graph algorithms. This menu is enabled after the creation of a graph.</p>

      <p><b>Algorithms => Best path:</b> Algorithms which try to find the best path between two vertices by using the weight of the edges as a factor.</p>

      <p><b>Algorithms => Best path => Bellman-Ford:</b> Opens a window to choose the source and destination vertex, and if "Show" is pressed, executes the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and displays the results in a new window.</p>

      <p><b>Algorithms => Best path => Dijkstra:</b> Opens a window to choose the source and destination vertex, and if "Show" is pressed executes Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, and displays the results in a new window.</p>

      <p><b>Algorithms => Traversal:</b> Graph traversal algorithms, which do not use the weight of the edges as a factor when trying to find the best path.</p>

      <p><b>Algorithms => Traversal => DFS:</b> Opens a window to choose the source and destination vertex, and if "Show" is pressed executes the Depth First Search traversal algorithm, and displays the results in a new
	window.</p>

      <p><b>Algorithms => Traversal => BFS:</b> Opens a window to choose the source and destination vertex, and if "Show" is pressed executes the Breadth First Search traversal algorithm, and displays the results in a new window.

	<p><b>Help:</b> Various help resources.</p>

	<p><b>Help => Quick usage:</b> This menu.</p>

	<p><b>Help => About:</b> Various information related with GraphNetwork (creator, license, etc).</p>

	<p>After the creation of a graph, you can right click any of the vertices or edges, and a popup menu with useful control options will apear:</p>

	<p><b>Right click an edge => Hide Edge:</b> Use this option to hide an edge. Note that edges are always directed, so you must hide an edge from both side to make it invisible.</p>

	<p><b>Left click a vertex:</b> Only the directly connected vertices with this vertex remain visible, all the others are collapsed.</p>

	<p><b>Right click a vertex => Expand Node:</b> Expands the vertex, if it is collapsed.</p>

	<p><b>Right click a vertex => Hide Node:</b> Hides the vertex.</p>

	<p><b>Right click a vertex => Center Node:</b> Moves the vertex to the central point of the graph.</p>
